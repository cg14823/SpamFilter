Part 1 (40%):

Your program classifies the testing set with an accuracy significantly higher than random within 30 minutes
Use very simple data preprocessing so that the emails can be read into the Naive Bayes (remove everything
else other than words from emails)
Write simple Naive Bayes multinomial classifier or use an implementation from a library of your choice
Classify the data
Report your results with a metric (e.g. accuracy) and method (e.g. cross validation) of your choice
Choose a baseline and compare your classifier against it

Part 2 (30%):

Use some smart feature processing techniques to improve the classification results
Compare the classification results with and without these techniques
Analyse how the classification results depend on the parameters (if available) of chosen techniques
Compare (statistically) your results against any other algorithm of your choice (use can use any library);
compare and contrast results, ensure fair comparison

Part 3 (30%):

Calibration (15%): calibrate Naive Bayes probabilities, such that they result in low mean squared error
Naive Bayes extension (15%): modify the algorithm in some interesting way (e.g. weighted Naive Bayes)
